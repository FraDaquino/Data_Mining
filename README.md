# Data_Mining
Data Mining Project at @UniPi a.y. 2023/24

This project aims to leverage Data Mining techniques to explore and analyze music data from Spotify. By applying advanced algorithms and methods, we extract meaningful insights and hidden patterns from the provided dataset. The project utilizes two distinct datasets: the first contains a wide variety of tracks across 114 different genres, along with metadata on the artists. The second dataset consists of time series data representing the spectral centroids of audio files, with 10,000 time series (500 for each of the 20 musical genres).

The project is organized into five key modules:
1. **Data Exploration and Preparation:** Establishing a solid foundation by exploring and preparing both datasets for further analysis.
2. **Time Series Analysis:** Focusing on the analysis of audio data through time series techniques.
3. **Advanced Preprocessing:** Employing techniques like outlier detection and handling, as well as imbalanced learning methods to address classification challenges with imbalanced target variables.
4. **Classification and Regression Models:** Applying advanced classification and regression methods, evaluating the performance of these models, and comparing the obtained results.
5. **Model Explainability:** Using explainability techniques to make the models interpretable and to gain deeper insights into the decision-making processes behind the predictions.
